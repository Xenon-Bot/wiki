# Xenons FAQ

This is the FAQ for Xenon, if nothing on this page answers your question, come and ask in the [support server!](https://xenon.bot/support)

<br />

## My backup is missing and I didn't delete it! Where is it?

Make sure you made it on your **current account**, backups are limited to their creator. This is the result of a [discussion with discord](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/412360041300230168/480494807823810590/unknown.png) to protect the bot against abuse.

It is also common that people **accidently copy their backup ID incorrectly**, please double check, especially the difference between an `l` (L character) and a `1` (number one).

If this still isn't the issue, your backup may be older than 11th of April 2019, backups older than this have been deleted.

<br />

## I got an error, what do I do?

Read the error carefully and think about what it says, the errors are written as clearly as possible and should be easy to understand. We cannot write them any clearer for you.

If it says you have reached a limit, we usually cannot do anything about them, so please just wait for the limit to expire or consider doing what it suggests.

<br />

## What is the best template? Is there a template for ...

You can **search on the [templates site](https://templates.xenon.bot)** to find the template you are looking for.

<br />

## I donated or bought Xenon pro, but I did not get a role?

You need to **connect your discord account** to patreon in the [settings tab.](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps) If you already connected it, try to disconnect and reconnect it.

Thanks for your donation!

<br />

## How do I create a backup?

Do `x!backup create`, you will then be messaged a backup ID which you can use to restore your server with `x!backup load` followed by the ID xenon sends you.

<br />

## How can I load / create a template?

You can **find templates at [templates.xenon.bot](https://templates.xenon.bot)**, then simply click "Use" to use it.

To create a template, first sign in, **click on your username in the top right, and then "add"**. You can find out more detailed steps [here](/templates#creating-a-template).

If you want to use one of Xenon's **old** templates, you can use `x!template load name`, or search the old templates with `x!template search`.

<br />

## Where can I report bugs or suggest something?

You can **create an issue on [github](https://github.com/Xenon-Bot/xenon-main/issues)** for suggestions or bug reports.
